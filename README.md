-The website I designed to enhance my machine learning model, developed using my collected data, to make it more user-friendly

-This project includes a website for car evaluations and a machine learning model. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a tool to predict car values. Here are the different stages of the project:

# 1. Data Collection
In this stage, I collected more than 12,000 car data from the internet using the Selenium library. These data represent the foundation of the project.
# 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data is a crucial step in the data analysis and model-building process. During the data preprocessing stage, we cleaned the data, filled in missing values, and applied data transformations when necessary.
# 3. Machine Learning Model
After preparing the data, I selected and trained the most suitable machine learning model. Our model has the ability to predict car values and helps users obtain the estimated value of the car they are interested in.
# 4. Website Development
I developed a website using the Django Framework. This website allows users to input car details and get estimated values. The website features a user-friendly design.
# 5.  Model Serialization
I serialized the machine learning model using the .joblib file format. This enables us to make the model readily available on the website.
# 6. Website Deployment
In the final stage, I successfully deployed the website using [Render](https://render.com/). The website is now accessible [here](https://car-worth-wizard.onrender.com/).
